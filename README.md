# Building an App with Redis

This project demonstrates how to build an application using **Redis**.



## Prerequisites

Prerequisites for using Redis
Before starting to develop an application with Redis, it is essential to have the following:

- Configured development environment: A system with a compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows) and basic programming tools.
- Redis installed: The latest version of Redis can be downloaded from the official website or installed using a package manager like apt (Ubuntu) or brew (macOS).
- Basic programming knowledge: Familiarity with a language compatible with Redis, such as Python, Node.js, Java, or any other with available Redis libraries.
- Redis client: A tool like redis-cli to interact directly with the database during development and testing.

## Installation

### 1. Install Redis

Download and install Redis on your machine. For Linux based systems, use:
"sudo apt update"
"sudo apt install redis"

Once installed, verify that Redis is running with:
"redis-server"

### 2. Install the client library in your preferred language

Redis requires a client library to interact from your application. For example:
For Python:

"pip install redis"
For Node.js:

"npm install redis"
```

### 3. Connecting your application to Redis

Use the client to establish a connection. For example:
For Python:
"import redis"
"r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, decode_responses=True)"
For Node.js:
"const redis = require('redis');"
"const client = redis.createClient({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' });"
"client.connect();"
